This is the code for an app that functions as a tourist's guide to the MTA Subway System. It starts off at a homepage with five buttons, each taking the user to a different page.

SubwayPage- Takes the user to a page that has a series of buttons shaped after each MTA Subway line. Upon pressing a button, it takes the user to the official MTA page of that line.
Stations- A page where the user can asynchronously type in and store their favorite subway stations.
MapPage- A map of the NYC subway, with pinch-zoom functionality.
PhotoGallery- A page where the user can take photos and asynchronously save them. Perfect for taking photos on the NYC subway!
Route Finder- An OpenAI powered page that helps the user figure out how to get from one place to another!
